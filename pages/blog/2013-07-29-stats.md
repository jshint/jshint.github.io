A few months ago I started sending data from this website to [Keen.IO](https://keen.io/),
a small San Francisco-based company specializing in the API for custom analytics. Last
weekend, I finally found some time to look at the numbers.

In the past six months **169,000** JavaScript programs were linted through this
website (we do not send any data from our our library or CLI progam in any way) and
only 15% of them passed the checks. The average program consisted of 507
lines of code while the largest program had **101,000** lines in it. This means
someone copied one hunder and one thousand lines of code, pasted it into our
[editor](http://jshint.com/) and pressed `lint`. In total, JSHint processed
**86,000,000** lines of code through this website exclusively. Only 40% of our users
used default JSHint settings, while 60% of them tweaked the settings in one way or
another.

As for our NPM module, the NPM website tells us that the package has been downloaded
**211,000** times **in the last month**.

That's it for now. I will continue to play with Keen.IO and our data to see if it gives
me any additional insight into JSHint and its users.
