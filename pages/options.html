<p>When set to true, these options will make JSHint produce more warnings about your code.</p>

<p>When set to true, these options will make JSHint produce fewer warnings about your code.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor" href="#environments" name="environments">Environments</a></h3>

<p>These options let JSHint know about some pre-defined global variables.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the JSHint project is no longer accepting new
library-specific "environment" options. Please use <a href="/docs">the
<code>globals</code> configuration option</a> to manage globally-defined
bindings. (JavaScript libraries come and go, and even the most popular and
stable are subject to change over time. Supporting multiple versions
concurrently increases maintenance burden and introduces coordination issues
that are best avoided by allowing consumers to explicitly manage custom rules
in their own projects' configurations.  Those libraries that are currently
supported are maintained only to honor commitments made before this change in
policy.)</p>
