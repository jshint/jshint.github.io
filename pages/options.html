JSHint comes with a
<a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/blob/master/examples/.jshintrc">default set</a>
of warnings but it was designed to be very configurable. Most often, when you need to
tune JSHint to your own taste, all you need to do is to find an appropriate option.
JSHint has two types of options: enforcing and relaxing. The former are used to make JSHint
more strict, while the latter are used to suppress some warnings.

<h3><a class="anchor" href="#enforcing-options" name="enforcing-options">Enforcing options</a></h3>

<p>When set to true, these options will make JSHint produce more warnings about your code.</p>

{{>option-table options.enforcers }}

<h3><a class="anchor" href="#relaxing-options" name="relaxing-options">Relaxing options</a></h3>

<p>When set to true, these options will make JSHint produce fewer warnings about your code.</p>

{{>option-table options.relaxers }}

<h3><a class="anchor" href="#environments" name="environments">Environments</a></h3>

<p>These options let JSHint know about some pre-defined global variables.</p>

{{>option-table options.environments }}

<h3><a class="anchor" href="#unstable" name="unstable">Unstable</a></h3>

<p>These options enable behavior which is subject to change between major releases of JSHint. Exercise caution when enabling them in automated environments (e.g. continuous integration).</p>
